I came across the [Google Maps Builder](http://googlemapbuilder.mynameisdonald.com/) by [Donald Sutherland](http://mynameisdonald.com/) today. It’s a highly useful tool that gives you access to the Google Maps API in a WISYWIG format. It allows you to build a goole map for your website in just minutes, without ever having to look at the actual API. The interface is neat and easy to use, and gives you access to the core API functionality, like Zoom Control, Scale Control, Draggable, and a host of others.

On top of this super neat interface, you can theme your map using a selection of themes from Snazzy Maps. It doesn’t get much easier than that. Overall, I’m highly impressed with the ease of use of this online tool, and will definitely be visiting using it for future projects.
