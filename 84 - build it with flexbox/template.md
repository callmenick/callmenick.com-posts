## Introduction

A while back, I wrote an article for SitePoint introducing flexbox. In that article, I investigated and tried to answer the question:

> Are we ready to use flexbox?

Back then, I said you'd have to choose wisely when to use it, but insisted that you should start getting familiar with the syntax and incorporating it into your modern projects. Today, I'm happy to assertively answer the question one more time:

> Yes, we are ready to use flexbox!

If you're unfamiliar with flexbox, then here's a quick primer. The [CSS Flexible Layout Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) is a layout module that allows us to easily layout boxes on the screen, given the available space. It is a big improvement over the traditional box model, given that it doesn't use floats at all. Boxes can be arranged in rows or columns, specific orders can be set for flexbox items, and there are a host of alignment, spacing, and sizing options.

I probably won't cover every single aspect in this tutorial, so I suggest you read up on the MDN link referenced above if you want to sharpen up your overall knowledge on the topic. Rather, this tutorial will address some common layout problems, and show how quickly and easily we can build them. Every layout pattern I present will also be responsive, further showing the ease in which we can build with flexbox. Here's what we'll tacke:

Alright, let's dive in!

## 1 - A Simple Grid System

Grid systems govern a big part of layouts today, and the default CSS box-model behaviour has resulted in us resorting to floated layouts or inline-block hacks, both of which have their share of quirks. Flexbox allows us to really easily develop a powerful and scalable grid system with just a few lines of CSS. Let's dig in.

Imagine we had some simple markup like this:

```html

```

## 2 - The Holy Grail Layout

The holy grail layout is pretty famous in web design, and even in the age of web applications and all that jazz, this layout still plays a very important part on the web today - content-rich sites employ it heavily. Back in 2006, the holy grail layout was beautifully achieved and [documented on A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/holygrail). 

## 3 - Vertical Alginment
