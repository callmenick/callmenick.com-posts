## Excerpt

In this article, we’re going to take a look at the [CSS `will-change` property](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-will-change/), what it is, when and how to use it, and how not to use it. There’s quite a bit of technical documentation available with regards to will-change, so I’ll reference a lot of those resources throughout this article, and compile them in a list at the end. This article will serve as an overview of the important parts with some quick examples.
