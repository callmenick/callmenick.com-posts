## Excerpt

Web applications, as opposed to just informational websites, are being more and more utilised as the web continues to mature. Two cutting edge and leading examples of web applications are Gmail and Dropbox. As web apps continue to grow in functionality, accessibility, and usefulness, the need to streamline their efficiency also increases. An emerging (and highly useful) concept that’s being utilised by the two formerly mentioned apps is a customised context menu. In this tutorial, we’re going to cover a few things:

1. Define what a context menu actually is, and understand its purpose and position in web application architecture.
2. Use front-end code to build our very own custom context menu, from styling with CSS, to triggering with JavaScript
3. Top it all off with a little discussion on the practicalities of customised context menus, and some do’s and don’ts when it comes to production-level implementations.
